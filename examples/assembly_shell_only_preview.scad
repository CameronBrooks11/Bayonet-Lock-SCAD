// Example: composite assembly that previews fast via shell_only

//
// The locking channel is a boolean-heavy cut, so an assembly holding several bayonets
// gets slow to pan long before it gets slow to render. Setting the dynamically scoped
// $bayonet_shell_only special variable once, at the top of the assembly, drops the
// pin/channel features from every bayonet() call below it - including calls buried
// inside your own modules - while leaving the coupling envelope intact.
//
// Wiring it to $preview gives the usual OpenSCAD workflow: F5 previews the assembly as
// bare shells, F6 renders the real geometry. Nothing else in the file changes.
//
// Try it: comment the line out and pan the preview to feel the difference.
