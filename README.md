# bayonet-Lock-SCAD

This OpenSCAD library provides a parametric bayonet lock connector, inspired by designs used in aviation maintenance for their reliability and ease of use. It allows for the creation of both the pin and lock components, with options for two or four locking points.

Key features:

- Customizable inner and outer radii to ensure a solid pin and lock.
- Adjustable gap parameter for tuning fit tolerance.
- Optional lip removal by setting its height to zero.
- Default detail setting (48) optimized for compatibility with FreeCAD.

The design improves upon earlier versions by modularizing the code and addressing issues from the original implementation. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
