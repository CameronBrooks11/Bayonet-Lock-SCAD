# bayonet-Lock-SCAD

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD060 -->

This OpenSCAD library provides a parametric bayonet lock connector, inspired by designs used in aviation maintenance for their reliability and ease of use. It produces both the pin and lock halves of the mechanism with a fully configurable number of locking points and turn direction.

Key features:

- Configurable number of locking pins (2 or more), evenly spaced or at explicit `pin_angles`.
- Optional keying: an uneven pin pattern gives the coupling a single locked orientation.
- Configurable interface radius (`interface_radius`) with optional shell wall thickness (`shell_thickness`) for any coupling diameter.
- Optional `entry_depth`; when omitted it defaults to `part_height * 0.5`.
- `pin_direction` parameter selects whether the pin protrudes inward or outward.
- Adjustable `allowance` (clearance gap) for tuning fit tolerance.
- Preview-aware `$fn` (64 preview / 128 render) for fast iteration.
- Optional `shell_only` mode that drops the locking features for fast assembly previews.

The design improves upon earlier versions by modularizing the code and addressing issues from the original implementation. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Usage

```scad
use <bayonet_lock.scad>;

bayonet(
  half            = "pin",    // "pin" | "lock"
  interface_radius = 10,
  shell_thickness = 2.5,       // optional; defaults to pin_radius * 2
  allowance       = 0.2,
  part_height     = 10,
  // entry_depth  = 5,        // optional; defaults to part_height * 0.5
  number_of_pins  = 3,        // or pin_angles = [...], see keying below
  pin_radius      = 1,
  sweep_angle     = 30,       // degrees; must be < the smallest gap between pins
  pin_direction   = "outer",  // "inner" | "outer"
  turn_direction  = "CW",     // "CW" | "CCW"
  // shell_only   = false     // optional; omit the locking features, see below
);
```

## Keying the locked orientation (`pin_angles`)

Evenly spaced pins carry that spacing's rotational symmetry, so an n-pin coupling has **n
indistinguishable locked positions**. Nothing in the geometry prefers one: a 3-pin half mates
just as happily at 0°, 120° and 240°.

That is harmless while both halves are axisymmetric, and wrong the moment one of them carries
an orientation — a baffle, a tilted sensor, a keyed connector. Such a part seated one position
out locks correctly and points somewhere else, with no resistance to tell the assembler.

`pin_angles` places the pins outright instead of spacing them evenly. Any unequal spacing
removes the symmetry, which is how a BA15d lamp cap keys its two pins:

```scad
pin_angles = bayonet_keyed_pin_angles(3, 25);   // [0, 95, 240] - evenly spaced, one pin back 25°

bayonet(half = "lock", pin_angles = pin_angles, ...);
```

Give exactly one of `number_of_pins` or `pin_angles`. `sweep_angle` must fit the smallest gap
in the pattern, which for even spacing is the familiar `360/number_of_pins`.

**Being keyed is not the same as being blocked.** Symmetry only says a wrong seating is not
*identical*; whether it is *prevented* depends on how far the offset throws the pins clear of
the channel mouths. Check the margin against the mouth's half-width:

```scad
assert(bayonet_pin_pattern_margin(pin_angles)
       > bayonet_channel_half_angle(interface_radius, pin_radius, allowance));
```

A key smaller than that still reads as keyed and still lets a wrong attempt start to go in.

## Fast assembly previews (`shell_only`)

The locking channel is a boolean-heavy cut, so an assembly holding several bayonets becomes
slow to pan long before it becomes slow to render. `shell_only` drops the pin and channel
features and emits just the bare coupling shell — same shell radii, same height, no locking
geometry.

The pin bosses are features, so they go too: a pin half previews `pin_radius` smaller in
radius than it prints. Preview the couplings this way to see where they sit, not to judge
clearance against whatever sits next to them. Rendering with `shell_only` still active echoes
a warning, since the emitted part would have nothing to lock with.

Because assemblies are previewed and only parts are rendered, the natural wiring is
`$preview`. `shell_only` falls back to the dynamically scoped `$bayonet_shell_only` special
variable, so an assembly opts in **once** at its top level rather than threading an argument
through every intermediate module:

```scad
$bayonet_shell_only = $preview;   // F5 previews bare shells, F6 renders the real geometry
```

That reaches every `bayonet()` call below it, including calls buried inside your own modules.
An explicit `shell_only=` argument always wins over the special variable, so a single joint
can stay fully detailed while the rest of the assembly stays light, and `let()` scopes it to
part of a tree:

```scad
let($bayonet_shell_only = true) my_subassembly();
```

Validation is unaffected: every parameter is checked in `shell_only` mode too, so a preview
that passes will not surprise you with an assertion at render time.

The saving scales with the number of joints. In
[`examples/assembly_shell_only_preview.scad`](examples/assembly_shell_only_preview.scad)
the mode cuts the CSG tree from 752 nodes to 240, and removes every `rotate_extrude` and
channel cut except those of the one joint that opts out. On a comparable eight-half assembly
at `$fn = 64`, the CGAL render drops from ~104 s to ~3.8 s.

## Mating the two halves

Both halves are authored in a single frame. Instantiated at a common origin with matching
parameters they are **in the locked position** — no translation or rotation needed:

```scad
bayonet(half = "lock", ...);
bayonet(half = "pin",  ...);   // same origin, same parameters => locked
```

To show them at the entry position instead — pins at the channel mouths, before the turn —
rotate the pin half by `sweep_angle`, negative for `"CW"` and positive for `"CCW"`:

```scad
rotate([0, 0, turn_direction == "CW" ? -sweep_angle : sweep_angle])
  bayonet(half = "pin", ...);
```

Any rotation between the two is a valid mid-travel position. All of this holds for any
`entry_depth`, and throughout that range the halves stay clear of each other, so an
`intersection()` of the two that is non-empty means the parameters do not match.

The first five render the lock and pin side-by-side for visual inspection. `keyed_3pin.scad`
shows the halves locked and, beside them, the intersection at a wrong seating that a keyed
pattern refuses; `assembly_shell_only_preview.scad` shows them assembled into a multi-joint
model.
